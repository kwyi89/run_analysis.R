Peer Assessment 1 - run_analysis.R
==============
This repository contains the analysis that is used on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone datasets 
that in turn creates the tidy dataset.

The R Script does the following:
==============
1. Download and clean up the data
2. Label the columns as necessary.
3. Merge test and train datasets into one big dataset.
4. Create a tidy dataset that includes the average of each variable and each subject.

There will be two text files in the end: data_set.txt and tidy_data.txt
